Explanation

```
//import keys.js and node-spotify-api so that we can access the spotify export
var keys = require("./keys.js");
var Spotify = require('node-spotify-api');

var spotify = new Spotify(keys.spotify);

function spotifySearch(){

  if(searchTerm){

    spotify.search({ type: 'track', query: searchTerm }, function(err, data) {
      if (err) {
        return console.log('Error occurred: ' + err);
      }
   
      // console.log(data.tracks.items[0]); 

      console.log("Artist: " + data.tracks.items[0].artists[0].name);
      console.log("Song Name: " + data.tracks.items[0].name);
      console.log("Spotify Preview Link: " + data.tracks.items[0].external_urls.spotify);
      console.log("Album: " + data.tracks.items[0].album.name);
    });
  }
  else{
    spotify.search({ type: 'track', query: "The Sign by Ace of Base" }, function(err, data) {
      if (err) {
        return console.log('Error occurred: ' + err);
      }
     
      console.log(data.tracks.items[0]); 
      });
  }
  
  
}

# Learning points
<!-- Learning points where you would write what you thought was helpful -->
* node.js proved to be a powerful tool to divvy requests and inquiries that fit the user's needs. For the future, it may be useful to spend time researching node's capabilities and more effective debugging methods
* Moment JS allows developers to interact more fluidly with a generally difficult-to-deal-with user input - time
